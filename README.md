# djOldAssemblerSource286
Some of my old source code from 1990s (seemingly a prior attempt to initially write Dave Gnukem in 80286 assembly language in 1994, 16-bit EGA - sometime in 1995 I more sensibly started again in C++). Uploading on the off chance someone finds this useful. This was using Turbo Assembler.
